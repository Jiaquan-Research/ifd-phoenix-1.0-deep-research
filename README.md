# IFD / Phoenix 1.0: Empirical Audit of Delay-Induced Phase Collapse

> **Status: FROZEN / SEALED** > This repository is a research artifact. Codebase dynamics are locked to a frozen Baseline.

## 📋 What This Is

**IFD / Phoenix 1.0** is an **empirical failure audit instrument**. 

It is designed to isolate and measure the **structural failure boundaries** (Phase Collapse) in survival-driven systems when feedback delays exceed physical tolerance.

This project serves as a **measurement probe**, utilizing frozen core dynamics to reveal mechanism-level failure modes without the interference of learning or internal optimization.

## ⛔ What This Is NOT

To prevent misinterpretation, the scope is strictly bounded:

- ❌ **Not an alignment algorithm** or solution.
- ❌ **Not a controller** or optimizer for deployment.
- ❌ **Not a training method** (No RL/Gradient Descent involved).
- ❌ **Not a claim about intelligence**, agency, or cognition.
- ❌ **Not a mitigation strategy** for delayed systems.

*It is purely a diagnostic instrument for identifying when and how systems break.*
